                    <p>It was during 1985–1986 that the band wrote most of its classic material, including "Welcome to
                        the
                        Jungle," "Sweet Child o' Mine", and "Paradise City," </p>

                    <p>In 1994, Slash formed Slash's Snakepit, a side project that featured his Guns N' Roses bandmates
                        Matt Sorum and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively, as well as Alice in Chains'
                        Mike Inez on bass and Jellyfish's Eric Dover on vocals. </p>
                    <li>2002–2008: Velvet Revolver</li>
                    <p>In 2002, Slash reunited with Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum for a Randy Castillo tribute concert.
                        Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form
                        a new band together. </p>
                    <li>2009–present: "Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators"</li>
                    <p>In September 2008, Slash began production on his debut solo album.</p>
                    <li>2016–present: Return to Guns N' Roses</li>
                    <p>On December 29, 2015, several days after a Guns N' Roses-related teaser was released to movie
                        theaters, Billboard reported that Slash would rejoin the band to headline Coachella 2016,
                        filling the lead guitarist spot vacated when DJ Ashba left the band.</p>

                <p>James Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American musician and songwriter best known for being
                    the co-founder, lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist and main songwriter for the heavy metal band
                    Metallica.
                    Hetfield is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar
                    duties
                    and solos, both live and in the studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after
                    answering an
                    advertisement by drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler. Metallica has won
                    nine
                    Grammy Awards and released ten studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles.

                    <p>The band's concert repertoire grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing at local
                        nightclubs and bars.[13] The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape
                        produced by the then-drummer of Fear and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI.</p>
                    <li>Mainstream success and side projects (1989–1998)</li>
                    <p>Flea and his wife Loesha started to grow apart, and he began trying to recreate the memories of
                        his adolescence by smoking marijuana on a daily basis.[26] The Chili Peppers entered the studio,
                        and completed recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989.</p>
                    <li>Californication, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium (1998–2007)</li>
                    <p>With Frusciante back on guitar, the band began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in
                        Flea's garage.[17] He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album after the
                        disappointing results of One Hot Minute. </p>
                    <li>Chili Peppers hiatus, return to school, Atoms for Peace, and Helen Burns (2008–2012)</li>
                    <p>After the Chili Peppers announced a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music classes
                        at the University of Southern California. Beginning in the fall of 2008, he studied music
                        theory, composition and jazz trumpet.</p>
                    <li>Film and television</li>
                    <p>Flea has pursued a minor acting career since the mid-1980s. His first role was as young punk
                        Razzle in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia (1984). Shortly thereafter he starred alongside
                        the Chili Peppers, who played themselves, in the skate drama Thrashin' (1986).</p>
